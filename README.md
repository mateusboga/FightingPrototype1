# Tabletop20
Tabletop 20 is an online RPG simulator that you can play directly from your desktop. It is a game reviving the experience of SinglePlayer Roleplay Books where you and the dice decide the outcome of the story.
Currently under development, Tabletop 20 hopes to bring back the spirit of tabletop roleplay in an interesting and phisical way. It includes a d20 die, a backpack/inventory system and a battle system.
The stories are written in a simple Javascript format so as to be easly customizable.
